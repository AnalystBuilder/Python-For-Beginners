Hello everyone and welcome to the Python Programming for Beginners Course!

I absolutely love Python! I would go as far to say it's my favorite programming language out there (and I've used many). I've taught thousands of people how to use Python and I can't wait to teach out as well!

You can find me in a lot of different places!
